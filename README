This script provides "did" and "dad" which work like 
"dib" or "dip" but for unified diffs.
"did" deletes "@@  .." surrounded blocks from a diff file.
"dad" deletes the complete diff for one file.
See the script for more detailed behaviour.
They have proved to be invaluable for me as I often have to deal with unfied diffs.
